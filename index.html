              Here at Chernobyl Tours we offer bespoke tours, designed to fit
              around your individual or group's needs. Our service aims to
              provide you with a more personal experience of what remains of
              Chernobyl and Pripyat following the nuclear disaster that took
              place on 26th April 1986. See some of the more notable attactions
              from the 2 cities and their location on the map below.

            <h4>
              The Chernobyl disaster refers to a nuclear accident that took
              place in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the purpose built
              city of Pripyat. It is considered the worst nuclear accident in
              history, more lives were lost following the radiation released by
              the explosion than with the explosion itself. The radiation meant
              both Chernobyl and Pripyat were evacuated, the residents never
              retuning home leaving the cities to slowly crumble and be
              reclaimed by nature. The derelict cities, today, are still mostly
              empty with only workers maintaining the power plant, watching the
              checkpoints inside the exclusion zone and few inhabitants who
              refuse to leave the area.

                  1976 and 1989 with other similar structures dotted around
                  parts of the former USSR. The structure still stands tall

                  The name given to the 10 squared kilometer area surrounding
                  the Chernobyl power plant, the name was given due to
                  orange-red colour the pine trees turned after absorbing huge
                  amounts of radiation and dying. The forest was buried due to
                  the levels of radiation in the soil but remains one of the
                  most highly contaminated areas in the world.
